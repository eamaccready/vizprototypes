A short R script that attempts to visualize carbon emissions by country in three different ways and the same visualizations after they were exported to Adobe Illustrator so additional features could be added to the visualizations. This data set came from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, http://cdiac.ornl.gov/, via Gapminder’s site.(http://www.gapminder.org/data) This data shows the CO2 emissions per capita of 201 countries in metric tons. I chose to look at the top 50 emitters in 5 year increments between 1970 and 2010, which seemed long enough to see significant trends, but not so far back as to be overwhelming or suffer from large amounts of missing data. To determine who the top 50 emitters were I summed each row (from 1970 – 2010), sorted from largest to smallest and took the countries with the 50 largest amounts. The categorical variables being compared are Country and Year.
